# Pygame Chip-8 Interpreter

## Wishlist

* Main application window, where ROMs can be loaded and application can be configured

* Window for running the emulation

* Popup windows for debug information, performance monitoring, stack and memory inspectors, etc.

* Console for inputting commands on the fly (super wishlist item, tbh)
